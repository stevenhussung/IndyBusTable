Upcoming work to do:
- Need to create an honest bus route object for whatever the final form of the bus route data will be. 
- Need to figure out the multi-route issue. Currently buses that start mid-route screw up our table.
- Need to transpose the table so that stops appear at the top, each bus-drive appears on one row.
- Will need to figure out the odd/even row shading at some point.
- Tiny detail: Is it possible to pull the bay letter out to the stop header, instead of it being in-line? (It changes by day, but never *within* a given day.)
